What do you do at out of school care
with your friends?

2
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,722
We play with each other.
We play football and hide-and-seek.

3
00:00:56,097 --> 00:01:01,936
We run around, play tag.
Play games, like Stratego.

4
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:08,651
We go to the cinema.
And play together.

5
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,488
And are friends.

00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,408
BUTTONMAN

7
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,661
MAKING CHOICES IN
OUT OF SCHOOL CARE

8
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,631
Kids spend their free time
in out of school care.

9
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,676
Which means we have to
offer them a choice.

10
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,804
And they have to be able
to make a choice.

11
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,309
I am Buttonman!

12
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:47,982
And my speciality is
collecting buttons.

13
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:54,531
We can make kids' free time interesting

14
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,492
if we offer them
a wide range of activities.

15
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,080
We do that with
a mixed team of educators.

16
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:07,085
People who are good at sport and games.
People who are creative.

17
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,754
And we also do that
by working together.

18
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,800
By working together with partners
who each have their own expertise,

19
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,720
their own skills.

20
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:27,605
What is important to parents when
their children are at our centre

21
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:31,943
is that it feels like their "nest".
By that I mean

22
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:38,450
that they feel at home when they come.
That is very important to us.

23
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,331
Hey, how are you?

24
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,375
Fine?

25
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:53,298
In order to make this feel
like a home to the kids,

26
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:58,970
we try to decorate and equip it
so that it is as cosy as possible.

27
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,890
By making sure there are
things here, in the house,

28
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,935
for all children, for all ages.
Things they like playing with.

29
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:09,397
We have arranged it
in a number of corners,

30
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:13,234
in which they can find
things to play with.

31
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,863
Where they can choose
which corner they play in.

32
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,283
Or whether they'd rather sit
at the table and do something.

33
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,579
So the equipment present is important.
As is the choice they have

34
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,458
to do what they feel like doing.

35
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,378
I think that for the "nest",
as we call it,

36
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,172
which the kids come to,
that is very important.

37
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,840
What are you going to draw?

38
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,926
A crocodile.
A crocodile?

39
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,636
High-quality childcare

40
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:44,140
in which we try to create
a family atmosphere for the children

41
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,394
by sticking to fixed routines,
so that it is clear

42
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,646
what happens when,
what the day will be like.

43
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:54,526
Then they know what they can expect,
what will happen during the day.

44
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:59,989
Children's freedom of choice and
involvement are very important

45
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:03,284
because that contributes to
them feeling at home here.

46
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,246
Who has got some good ideas?
Yes, Helena?

47
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:10,792
Tomatoes, like today.
Yes.

48
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,460
How many have we got?

49
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,338
Next Monday you can choose between ...

50
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,299
Tomatoes and cucumber, or cheese.

51
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,677
Who wants tomato and cucumber?
Cheese.

52
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:24,639
The children who come to
out of school care are of various ages.

53
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:30,562
From the youngest infant school children
to the oldest junior school children.

54
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,983
And they are mixed a lot of the time.

55
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,611
We notice that the various
age groups seek each other out.

56
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,115
The moment we pick the children up
from school we see

57
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,452
that the big ones and little ones
are drawn to each other,

58
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,537
the big ones look after the little ones.

59
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,544
Three more things and we've finished.

60
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:59,716
When you've dried all the beakers,
put them in the cupboard there.

61
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,218
Yes, put them in the cupboard.

62
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,273
We base what we do on
the fact it's their free time

63
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,318
so the kids can learn to choose
what they want to do.

64
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,321
They can be bored,
if that's what they want.

65
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,032
But we also hold workshops every day,

66
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,953
run by our own educators,
doing crafts or sport and games,

67
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,915
about expression, about media.

68
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:39,923
"OK, all tiny tots with ginger hair
and freckles, off to bed!"

69
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,883
And he grabs Daantje by her arm

70
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,679
and drags her into the hall.
He pushes her into the little room.

71
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,973
"Goodnight, ginger," he says.
And he's gone.

72
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,310
Miss, his brother is with her?
Pardon?

73
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:56,439
His brother stayeded with her.
Yes, her brother also stays home

74
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,651
to look after his little sister.
He has put her to bed.

75
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,736
"Goodnight, ginger."
And he's gone.

76
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,364
We try to avoid
a classroom situation, as in:

77
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:09,035
"Now we're all going to do this."
In fact, with all our craft activities

78
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,789
we try to allow a degree of freedom.
They can choose their materials,

79
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:16,876
whether they cut and stick things,
or how they want to do it.

80
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:21,715
I don't think I've ever said:
"Now we're all going to make this."

81
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:40,817
As an educator, I think it's important
they can play in a group.

82
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:45,947
When children stand there by themselves,
I try to include them in the group.

83
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,993
So that we can form a group
and play together.

84
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,829
I think playing together
is very important.

85
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,373
Hold on, guys. I'm coming too.

86
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,752
This morning we went out in
the neighbourhood with the children.

87
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,963
To show out of school care
to the locals too.

88
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:07,510
Most people don't know about it,
unless their children come here.

89
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,555
That way we present a positive image

90
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:14,351
and show we are stimulating Dutch
here in the community too

91
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,811
and introducing the children to it.

92
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,065
Let's see if we can find another ribbon.

93
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:27,030
Yes, there's one. Be careful.
Do it together. Well done.

94
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,908
Yes, take the card out.

95
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:36,998
Question 1. You have to find
a lady or gentleman

96
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,418
and ask them if they will
blow the balloon up for you.

97
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:46,216
Thank you.
That's good, eh?

98
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,393
Smile.
Hi!

99
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,146
It's important to go round
the area with them

100
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,773
so that they get to know it

101
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,819
and also get to know other
organisations in the community

102
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:10,782
and that they can go there
in their free time.

103
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,098
The outdoor area is interesting
as lots of kids live in an apartment.

104
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:39,060
The parents don't always get the chance
to do active things with them.

105
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,772
Here they can really enjoy themselves,
they can run around,

106
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:47,819
ride a bike, climb and clamber
over things... Use up their energy.

107
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:53,450
In spite of the outdoor area, we try
to go on outings as much as possible.

108
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,703
The children enjoy it,
the educators enjoy it.

109
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,269
Now and then an activity is organised

110
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:25,315
among the out of school care centres in
Brussels. E.g. a football tournament,

111
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:30,570
a swimming competition, or a circus
performance that we all go to together.

112
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,411
The added value of a football tournament

113
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,247
is the team spirit,
which comes very much to the fore.

114
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,750
The children are proud of
their own centre

115
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,087
and they can show the other centres
who they are

116
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,465
and go for it together.
That is very important,

117
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,469
that team spirit in the team,
among the children and the educators.

118
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,324
This year, at our centre here in Jette,
we also started 

119
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:22,414
expanding our network.
We first looked to see

120
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,460
what organisations there are here
in the community and what they do.

121
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,506
Some looked really interesting
and we thought

122
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,509
we might be able to
work together with them.

123
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,846
So we approached them
and told them who we are,

124
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:44,060
how we work.
We then asked them an open question:

125
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,856
"Is there any way
we can work together?"

126
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,578
That's too small to go in there.

127
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:07,292
Kas takes the pot with her

128
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,295
to the toilet.

129
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,007
I think the library visits
are beneficial.

130
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,634
They go with school too

131
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,472
but I think it makes them
want to read more.

132
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,183
They're always told a story
at the library.

133
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,102
That's different from
reading a book at home.

134
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,272
There are so many different books
in the library.

135
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,859
They see someone else's book and
think that looks like a good one.

136
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:36,404
Oops. And that is Thursday.
What can we see on Thursday?

137
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,698
Hey, a flower.
Oh, another flower.

138
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:42,702
There's something else too.
Do you know what that is?

139
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,538
When we talk to the partners we notice

140
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:50,710
that they are very receptive to it.
They also see opportunities in it.

141
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,673
There are children they haven't
reached yet, haven't seen yet,

142
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,093
who maybe wouldn't
come to them so readily.

143
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:02,597
Via us, via out of school care,
they do come

144
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:07,018
and see what there is on offer,
see what they do.

145
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:13,983
There are nine slices of banana
and they are all in the fridge.

146
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,821
It is a story that rhymes, like a poem.

147
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,658
Do you know any poems? They rhyme, eh?
And this story rhymes too.

148
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:25,078
For children, working together
with the various partners means

149
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:29,624
that they get to know about
a variety of things on offer

150
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,002
that they wouldn't know about otherwise.

151
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:38,466
Can you do that? Sit down carefully,
without dropping a single plate?

152
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:44,139
Now put your finger up in there,
very carefully.

153
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:48,768
We're a circus workshop, or circus
school, in the centre of Brussels.

154
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,854
We started in the centre of Brussels

155
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:54,983
and grew out of five partners, including
De Buiteling out of school care centre.

156
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,111
We started working here
with all the partners

157
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,656
as we thought we could bring people
together via circus activities

158
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:06,369
and we knew that all the organisations
attracted a different target group.

159
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:10,040
We wanted to introduce them to
each other via the circus activities.

160
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,917
When she catches things,
she does it like a cat.

161
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,170
We invite educators to our activities,

162
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:18,548
which are taught by
professional circus teachers.

163
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:23,053
To supervise the children,
but also to see how things are taught.

164
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:27,599
Because we believe that it works and
children love doing circus activities,

165
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:31,978
we think it's great if the educators
can learn how it's taught too.

166
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:36,358
So we've started
a sort of extra training course.

167
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,526
Up. Up.

168
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,448
What is very important to us

169
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,701
is that we can also use
the limited infrastructure in Brussels

170
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,953
in an effective way.

171
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:53,124
We, the out of school care centre,
use our partners' premises

172
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,378
but our partners also use
our centre's premises during the day,

173
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,505
when they are empty.

174
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:06,096
Thanks to the photos
on the parents' notice board

175
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,056
the children tell their parents

176
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,892
about the activities they do with us
at the centre.

177
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,561
And also the activities
they do with our partners.

178
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:14,979
It's a handy tool

179
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,732
for talking to them
about working with the partners.

180
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,860
That way the parents, and
their children, find their way

181
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,322
to the partner organisations
outside of out of school care.

182
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:31,079
I think it is very good that we can
lead the children to other things,

183
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:34,833
to other organisations,
in an affordable way.

184
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,795
Then they get to know them
and are stimulated too.

185
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,932
Taking them to
the Youth Theatre is great.

186
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,269
Often their parents don't take them
as it is too expensive.

187
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:58,273
The culture vouchers system
isn't available to all parents.

188
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,942
But they can go there with us

189
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:05,655
and get to know it.
It's the same with museums and sport.

190
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,789
Try playing here too.

191
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:28,261
In a big city it is often difficult
for parents to find their way around,

192
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,556
where their children can go or
where they can go for assistance.

193
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,767
But where organisations work together

194
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,812
as part of community school
or other partnerships,

195
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,815
and the aim is
to lead parents to things,

196
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:45,528
various organisations can help
that happen in lots of different ways.

197
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,497
For years we have been thinking about

198
00:15:55,663 --> 00:16:00,377
and working on parent participation.
We want to start with the basics

199
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:04,172
and ensure everyday contact
with the parents goes well.

200
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,300
By taking plenty of time
to get to know each other,

201
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,011
to ensure we know the parents
and they know us.

202
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,264
It is important that
the parents are involved in our centre,

203
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,517
so they know
what their child does with us

204
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:19,145
but also so we know
what their child does at home.

205
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:23,858
Sometimes we also organise
activities with the parents,

206
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,654
for the parents. Today, for example,
a walk round the neighbourhood,

207
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:31,700
whereby we take the parents to
various organisations in the community.

208
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:35,328
Partners, who work together with us
to educate the children,

209
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,039
and where parents can go
with questions on education

210
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:41,001
or for activities with their children.

211
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:09,195
Working together with the school
is also very important.

212
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:13,116
There are children who come to
out of school care and go to the school.

213
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:16,995
I think it's great
that we can work together

214
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:22,709
and, if there are particular problems,
deal with them together.

215
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:27,297
That's why we have a lot of contact with
the head teacher, the care coordinator

216
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:31,301
and the teachers of the children who
come to the out of school care centre.

217
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,720
Usually about nice things that happen.

218
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:37,474
For example, the children go to
the farm. We tell their teacher,

219
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,685
so that the teacher can ask them
about it the next day

220
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:44,189
and the children can tell their teacher,
their care coordinator

221
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:47,942
or head teacher about it.
We notice that the children enjoy that.

222
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,500
The most exciting thing about my job
as a pedagogical coordinator

223
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,003
is seeing the children and
the parents and the educators

224
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,922
enjoy themselves at our centre.

225
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,841
The kids beam by the end of the day
and the parents are glad

226
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:15,095
they can collect happy children
from our centre.

227
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:19,182
There is so much for the children
to discover in different areas.

228
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:22,268
They can do sport, be creative,

229
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,105
play quietly with each other.

230
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,983
And all in a very peaceful,
pleasant, familiar atmosphere.

231
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,742
In addition, I see
the educators grow every day.

232
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,286
As a team, by working together
with each other,

233
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:45,959
and personally, we all learn things
at the out of school care centre.

234
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,046
Me.
Bye.
