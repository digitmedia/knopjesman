1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:06,089
We want to encourage parent
participation, in lots of areas.

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:11,219
We want to start with the basics
and ensure good everyday contact,

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,638
so we really get to know the parents.

4
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:17,726
It starts with that.
Then we also want to take various steps

5
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:19,602
to involve parents in the centre.

6
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:24,190
We think that's important as parents
are their children's first educators.

7
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:28,403
So they should know about everything
their children do at out of school care

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,198
and we in turn want to know
what the children do at home.

9
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,870
Our team came up with
a number of activities

10
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:40,206
in which we thought it would be nice
to involve the parents.

11
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,958
One was a story-reading workshop,

12
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,378
where the mums and dads were invited
to the childcare centre.

13
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,881
They all brought books from home

14
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,676
to read out loud to our children.
The educators were there too

15
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:56,348
and it was a great atmosphere
with parents, children and educators.

16
00:00:56,514 --> 00:01:01,144
Another example is mums who came
and took part in a dance workshop.

17
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,564
They danced with the children
and the educators.

18
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:09,110
We noticed that both the children
and the mums really, really enjoyed

19
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:14,407
doing an activity together with
each other and with the educators.

20
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:18,244
We have a good relationship
with the educators.

21
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,455
If you've been coming here
a few years,

22
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,875
there are some educators
who've been here a while too.

23
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,419
So they know an awful lot about us.

24
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,547
They know the problems at home too,
of course.

25
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,050
But they look after the children
really well.

26
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:37,222
Dorian was... I'm divorced now
and his godfather died recently too.

27
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,974
They looked after him really well
when it happened.

28
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,309
It's also nice for us

29
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:45,438
to be able to have a chat with them
in the evening sometimes.

30
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,482
They are a great support,

31
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:51,861
both for us and for the children.
They are always ready to help, always.

32
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,031
We use the parents' notice board

33
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,159
to announce the activities
we'll do this week,

34
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,579
but we also hang up photos of
the activities we've done.

35
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:05,041
Then the parents can see
what the children do here with us

36
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,712
but also which partners
the children go to,

37
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,465
so the parents can see
the work we do with partners.

38
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,471
Our parent contribution policy
is a very social one.

39
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:23,059
Parents pay according to their income.
People with the highest incomes

40
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,937
pay a reasonable amount
per half an hour.

41
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:30,734
And parents with the lowest income
pay 10 cents per half an hour.
