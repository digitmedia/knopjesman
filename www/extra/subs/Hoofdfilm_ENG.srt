1
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:50,626
What do you do at out of school care
with your friends?

2
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:55,751
We play with each other.
We play football and hide-and-seek.

3
00:00:56,125 --> 00:01:01,959
We run around, play tag.
- Play games, like Stratego.

4
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:08,667
We go to the cinema.
And play together.

5
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,501
And are friends.

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,417
BUTTONMAN

7
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:18,667
MAKING CHOICES IN
OUT OF SCHOOL CARE

8
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:29,667
Kids spend their free time
in out of school care.

9
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:32,709
Which means we have to
offer them a choice.

10
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:35,834
And they have to be able
to make a choice.

11
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:41,334
I am Buttonman!

12
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:48,000
And my speciality is
collecting buttons.

13
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,542
We can make kids' free time interesting

14
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:57,501
if we offer them
a wide range of activities.

15
00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:02,083
We do that with
a mixed team of educators.

16
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:07,125
People who are good at sport and games.
People who are creative.

17
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:09,792
And we also do that
by working together.

18
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,834
By working together with partners
who each have their own expertise,

19
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:16,751
their own skills.

20
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:27,626
What is important to parents when
their children are at our centre

21
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:31,959
is that it feels like their "nest".
By that I mean

22
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:38,459
that they feel at home when they come.
That is very important to us.

23
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:45,334
Hey, how are you?

24
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,417
Fine?

25
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:53,334
In order to make this feel
like a home to the kids,

26
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:58,999
we try to decorate and equip it
so that it is as cosy as possible.

27
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,918
By making sure there are
things here, in the house,

28
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:05,959
for all children, for all ages.
Things they like playing with.

29
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:09,417
We have arranged it
in a number of corners,

30
00:03:09,584 --> 00:03:13,250
in which they can find
things to play with.

31
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:16,876
Where they can choose
which corner they play in.

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,292
Or whether they'd rather sit
at the table and do something.

33
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,584
So the equipment present is important.
As is the choice they have

34
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:28,459
to do what they feel like doing.

35
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:31,417
I think that for the "nest",
as we call it,

36
00:03:31,584 --> 00:03:34,209
which the kids come to,
that is very important.

37
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,876
What are you going to draw?

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,959
A crocodile.
- A crocodile?

39
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,667
High-quality childcare

40
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:44,167
in which we try to create
a family atmosphere for the children

41
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:47,417
by sticking to fixed routines,
so that it is clear

42
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,667
what happens when,
what the day will be like.

43
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:54,542
Then they know what they can expect,
what will happen during the day.

44
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:59,999
Children's freedom of choice and
involvement are very important

45
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:03,292
because that contributes to
them feeling at home here.

46
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:06,250
Who has got some good ideas?
Yes, Helena?

47
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:10,834
Tomatoes, like today.
- Yes.

48
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,501
How many have we got?

49
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:15,375
Next Monday you can choose between ...

50
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:18,334
Tomatoes and cucumber, or cheese.

51
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:20,709
Who wants tomato and cucumber?
- Cheese.

52
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:24,667
The children who come to
out of school care are of various ages.

53
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:30,584
From the youngest infant school children
to the oldest junior school children.

54
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:34,999
And they are mixed a lot of the time.

55
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:38,626
We notice that the various
age groups seek each other out.

56
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:42,125
The moment we pick the children up
from school we see

57
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:45,459
that the big ones and little ones
are drawn to each other,

58
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:47,542
the big ones look after the little ones.

59
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:54,584
Three more things and we've finished.

60
00:04:55,501 --> 00:04:59,751
When you've dried all the beakers,
put them in the cupboard there.

61
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:02,250
Yes, put them in the cupboard.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,292
We base what we do on
the fact it's their free time

63
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:18,334
so the kids can learn to choose
what they want to do.

64
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:21,334
They can be bored,
if that's what they want.

65
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:24,042
But we also hold workshops every day,

66
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:28,959
run by our own educators,
doing crafts or sport and games,

67
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,918
about expression, about media.

68
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:39,959
"OK, all tiny tots with ginger hair
and freckles, off to bed!"

69
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,918
And he grabs Daantje by her arm

70
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:45,709
and drags her into the hall.
He pushes her into the little room.

71
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:48,999
"Goodnight, ginger," he says.
And he's gone.

72
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:52,334
Miss, his brother is with her?
- Pardon?

73
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:56,459
His brother stayeded with her.
- Yes, her brother also stays home

74
00:05:56,626 --> 00:05:59,667
to look after his little sister.
He has put her to bed.

75
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:01,751
"Goodnight, ginger."
And he's gone.

76
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:04,375
We try to avoid
a classroom situation, as in:

77
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:09,042
"Now we're all going to do this."
In fact, with all our craft activities

78
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:12,792
we try to allow a degree of freedom.
They can choose their materials,

79
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,918
whether they cut and stick things,
or how they want to do it.

80
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:21,751
I don't think I've ever said:
"Now we're all going to make this."

81
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:40,834
As an educator, I think it's important
they can play in a group.

82
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:45,959
When children stand there by themselves,
I try to include them in the group.

83
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:50,000
So that we can form a group
and play together.

84
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:52,834
I think playing together
is very important.

85
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:55,375
Hold on, guys. I'm coming too.

86
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:58,792
This morning we went out in
the neighbourhood with the children.

87
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,999
To show out of school care
to the locals too.

88
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:07,542
Most people don't know about it,
unless their children come here.

89
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:10,584
That way we present a positive image

90
00:07:10,751 --> 00:07:14,375
and show we are stimulating Dutch
here in the community too

91
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:16,834
and introducing the children to it.

92
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:20,083
Let's see if we can find another ribbon.

93
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:27,042
Yes, there's one. Be careful.
Do it together. Well done.

94
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:29,918
Yes, take the card out.

95
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:36,999
Question 1. You have to find
a lady or gentleman

96
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,459
and ask them if they will
blow the balloon up for you.

97
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,250
Thank you.
- That's good, eh?

98
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:56,417
Smile.
- Hi!

99
00:07:57,834 --> 00:08:00,167
It's important to go round
the area with them

100
00:08:00,334 --> 00:08:01,792
so that they get to know it

101
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,834
and also get to know other
organisations in the community

102
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:10,792
and that they can go there
in their free time.

103
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:35,125
The outdoor area is interesting
as lots of kids live in an apartment.

104
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:39,083
The parents don't always get the chance
to do active things with them.

105
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,792
Here they can really enjoy themselves,
they can run around,

106
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,834
ride a bike, climb and clamber
over things... Use up their energy.

107
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:53,459
In spite of the outdoor area, we try
to go on outings as much as possible.

108
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:56,709
The children enjoy it,
the educators enjoy it.

109
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:21,292
Now and then an activity is organised

110
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:25,334
among the out of school care centres in
Brussels. E.g. a football tournament,

111
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:30,584
a swimming competition, or a circus
performance that we all go to together.

112
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,417
The added value of a football tournament

113
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:41,250
is the team spirit,
which comes very much to the fore.

114
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:43,792
The children are proud of
their own centre

115
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,125
and they can show the other centres
who they are

116
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:50,501
and go for it together.
That is very important,

117
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,501
that team spirit in the team,
among the children and the educators.

118
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:16,334
This year, at our centre here in Jette,
we also started 

119
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:22,417
expanding our network.
We first looked to see

120
00:10:22,584 --> 00:10:27,501
what organisations there are here
in the community and what they do.

121
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:31,542
Some looked really interesting
and we thought

122
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:34,542
we might be able to
work together with them.

123
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:37,876
So we approached them
and told them who we are,

124
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,083
how we work.
We then asked them an open question:

125
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,876
"Is there any way
we can work together?"

126
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:01,584
That's too small to go in there.

127
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:07,334
Kas takes the pot with her

128
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,334
to the toilet.

129
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:14,042
I think the library visits
are beneficial.

130
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:16,667
They go with school too

131
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:20,501
but I think it makes them
want to read more.

132
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:23,209
They're always told a story
at the library.

133
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:26,125
That's different from
reading a book at home.

134
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:29,292
There are so many different books
in the library.

135
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:32,876
They see someone else's book and
think that looks like a good one.

136
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,417
Oops. And that is Thursday.
What can we see on Thursday?

137
00:11:36,584 --> 00:11:38,709
Hey, a flower.
- Oh, another flower.

138
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:42,709
There's something else too.
Do you know what that is?

139
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:45,542
When we talk to the partners we notice

140
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:50,751
that they are very receptive to it.
They also see opportunities in it.

141
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:54,709
There are children they haven't
reached yet, haven't seen yet,

142
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:58,125
who maybe wouldn't
come to them so readily.

143
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:02,626
Via us, via out of school care,
they do come

144
00:12:02,876 --> 00:12:07,042
and see what there is on offer,
see what they do.

145
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:14,000
There are nine slices of banana
and they are all in the fridge.

146
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:17,834
It is a story that rhymes, like a poem.

147
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:21,667
Do you know any poems? They rhyme, eh?
And this story rhymes too.

148
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:25,083
For children, working together
with the various partners means

149
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,626
that they get to know about
a variety of things on offer

150
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:32,042
that they wouldn't know about otherwise.

151
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:38,501
Can you do that? Sit down carefully,
without dropping a single plate?

152
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:44,167
Now put your finger up in there,
very carefully.

153
00:12:44,334 --> 00:12:48,792
We're a circus workshop, or circus
school, in the centre of Brussels.

154
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,876
We started in the centre of Brussels

155
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and grew out of five partners, including
De Buiteling out of school care centre.

156
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:58,125
We started working here
with all the partners

157
00:12:58,292 --> 00:13:01,667
as we thought we could bring people
together via circus activities

158
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:06,375
and we knew that all the organisations
attracted a different target group.

159
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:10,042
We wanted to introduce them to
each other via the circus activities.

160
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:12,918
When she catches things,
she does it like a cat.

161
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,209
We invite educators to our activities,

162
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,584
which are taught by
professional circus teachers.

163
00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:23,083
To supervise the children,
but also to see how things are taught.

164
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,626
Because we believe that it works and
children love doing circus activities,

165
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:31,999
we think it's great if the educators
can learn how it's taught too.

166
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:36,375
So we've started
a sort of extra training course.

167
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:38,542
Up. Up.

168
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:43,459
What is very important to us

169
00:13:43,626 --> 00:13:46,709
is that we can also use
the limited infrastructure in Brussels

170
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:48,959
in an effective way.

171
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,125
We, the out of school care centre,
use our partners' premises

172
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:56,417
but our partners also use
our centre's premises during the day,

173
00:13:56,584 --> 00:13:58,542
when they are empty.

174
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:06,125
Thanks to the photos
on the parents' notice board

175
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:08,083
the children tell their parents

176
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,918
about the activities they do with us
at the centre.

177
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:13,584
And also the activities
they do with our partners.

178
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:14,999
It's a handy tool

179
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,751
for talking to them
about working with the partners.

180
00:14:17,918 --> 00:14:20,876
That way the parents, and
their children, find their way

181
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,334
to the partner organisations
outside of out of school care.

182
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:31,083
I think it is very good that we can
lead the children to other things,

183
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,834
to other organisations,
in an affordable way.

184
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,834
Then they get to know them
and are stimulated too.

185
00:14:48,584 --> 00:14:50,959
Taking them to
the Youth Theatre is great.

186
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,292
Often their parents don't take them
as it is too expensive.

187
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:58,292
The culture vouchers system
isn't available to all parents.

188
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:00,959
But they can go there with us

189
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:05,667
and get to know it.
It's the same with museums and sport.

190
00:15:11,918 --> 00:15:14,792
Try playing here too.

191
00:15:24,751 --> 00:15:28,292
In a big city it is often difficult
for parents to find their way around,

192
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:31,584
where their children can go or
where they can go for assistance.

193
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:33,792
But where organisations work together

194
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:37,834
as part of community school
or other partnerships,

195
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:40,834
and the aim is
to lead parents to things,

196
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:45,542
various organisations can help
that happen in lots of different ways.

197
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:55,501
For years we have been thinking about

198
00:15:55,667 --> 00:16:00,417
and working on parent participation.
We want to start with the basics

199
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:04,209
and ensure everyday contact
with the parents goes well.

200
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,334
By taking plenty of time
to get to know each other,

201
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:10,042
to ensure we know the parents
and they know us.

202
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:13,292
It is important that
the parents are involved in our centre,

203
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:15,542
so they know
what their child does with us

204
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:19,167
but also so we know
what their child does at home.

205
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:23,876
Sometimes we also organise
activities with the parents,

206
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,667
for the parents. Today, for example,
a walk round the neighbourhood,

207
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:31,709
whereby we take the parents to
various organisations in the community.

208
00:16:31,876 --> 00:16:35,334
Partners, who work together with us
to educate the children,

209
00:16:35,501 --> 00:16:38,042
and where parents can go
with questions on education

210
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:41,042
or for activities with their children.

211
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:09,209
Working together with the school
is also very important.

212
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:13,125
There are children who come to
out of school care and go to the school.

213
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:17,000
I think it's great
that we can work together

214
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:22,751
and, if there are particular problems,
deal with them together.

215
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:27,334
That's why we have a lot of contact with
the head teacher, the care coordinator

216
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:31,334
and the teachers of the children who
come to the out of school care centre.

217
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:33,751
Usually about nice things that happen.

218
00:17:33,918 --> 00:17:37,501
For example, the children go to
the farm. We tell their teacher,

219
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:40,709
so that the teacher can ask them
about it the next day

220
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:44,209
and the children can tell their teacher,
their care coordinator

221
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,959
or head teacher about it.
We notice that the children enjoy that.

222
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,501
The most exciting thing about my job
as a pedagogical coordinator

223
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:07,042
is seeing the children and
the parents and the educators

224
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:08,959
enjoy themselves at our centre.

225
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,876
The kids beam by the end of the day
and the parents are glad

226
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,125
they can collect happy children
from our centre.

227
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:19,209
There is so much for the children
to discover in different areas.

228
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,292
They can do sport, be creative,

229
00:18:22,626 --> 00:18:25,125
play quietly with each other.

230
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:28,999
And all in a very peaceful,
pleasant, familiar atmosphere.

231
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:37,751
In addition, I see
the educators grow every day.

232
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:40,292
As a team, by working together
with each other,

233
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:45,999
and personally, we all learn things
at the out of school care centre.

234
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,083
Me.
- Bye.
