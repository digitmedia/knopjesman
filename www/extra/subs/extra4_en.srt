I think kids learn a lot at
out of school care.

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:09,134
Our wide range of activities
involve lots of different skills.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,013
But we do them in a non-school-like way,
in a playful way.

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,641
For example, they can also lean
a lot of Dutch at our centre

5
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,977
simply by playing in Dutch.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:23,064
So Dutch isn't a compulsory language,
just a language they can have fun in.

7
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:27,402
That's important for the self-confidence
of kids who are non-native speakers.

8
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:32,032
And I'm certain that
they quietly learn a lot of Dutch.

9
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:44,544
At the library we are very anxious,
and it also our official task,

10
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,798
to increase children's
pleasure in reading.

11
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,384
You have to look at it
in the school context.

12
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,138
Because, in the end, reading,
especially here in Brussels

13
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,350
for a large percentage of kids
who are non-native speakers,

14
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:02,479
learning to read, the ability to read,
is a serious undertaking.

15
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:06,441
And the Dutch language
is on top of that.

16
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:12,280
Kas takes the pot

17
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,325
to the toilet.

18
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:19,746
We want to teach them to
take pleasure in reading.

19
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:24,751
We also want children to read
outside of school.

20
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:29,756
For their language skills,
learning to speak a language,

21
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,841
reading is very important.

22
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:36,471
As long as it is in the school context
of reading technique and skill,

23
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,099
it can sometimes be
too restrictive for children.

24
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:43,395
It is a task and we want to move away
from it being a task

25
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:48,608
and make reading something enjoyable.
An emotional experience

26
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,902
that a book, a story can create.

27
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,780
How many legs has a spider got?
Do you know?

28
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,824
Six.
- Count them.

29
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,826
Five.
- Six.

30
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:06,001
Five, six, seven, eight.
- Yes, a spider has got eight legs.

31
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,336
As an educator
I mainly try to ensure

32
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:12,298
that children also speak Dutch
during free play.

33
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,427
They automatically revert to
their own language

34
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:21,307
and I try to correct that by
joining in the conversation in Dutch.

35
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,893
Then they automatically change to Dutch.

36
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,355
No, put one finger down.
Yes, that's eight.

37
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,357
Have you got a naughty spider too?

38
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,068
As a language support coach
I coach the educators

39
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,029
in dealing with multilingual groups.

40
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,406
I help them by teaching them
how to handle

41
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:40,076
children who often come from
a non-Dutch speaking environment

42
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,871
and who come to
Dutch-speaking out of school care.

43
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,499
What do you do at out of school care
with your friends?

44
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:51,838
We play together, we play football.
We play hide-and-seek,

45
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:57,635
we run around, we play tag.
- Play games, like Stratego.

46
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:03,058
Speak a lot of Dutch and play together.

47
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:07,520
And are, make friends.
- Are friends. Make friends.

48
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,566
Dutch at out of school care is
important for the educators too,

49
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,944
it also gives them a chance
to learn Dutch.

50
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,447
They come into contact with
children and parents.

51
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,700
So it's a win-win situation for them.

52
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,120
We only speak Dutch with the children

53
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,706
but in the interests of
good communication

54
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,501
we speak any language we know
with the parents.

55
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:33,546
That could be sign language,
French, Dutch...

56
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:38,718
All educators can try using
the languages he or she knows.
