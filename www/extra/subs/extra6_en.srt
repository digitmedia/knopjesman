1
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,303
In fact, we come here and play

2
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,974
but we play with the children
in an educational way.

3
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,477
It is a really great job.

4
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:24,983
There are new children every year.
And a wide range of activities.

5
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,819
It's not a typical nine-to-five job.

6
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,947
It is a great job
with an awful lot of variety.

7
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,991
Working with children is always exciting.

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:42,375
For me, being an educator
means playing and enjoying myself.

9
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:49,424
It also means preparing things,
finishing programmes, meeting deadlines.

10
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,927
I think children like coming to us

11
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:58,141
because, after sitting in class all day,
when they get here they can finally

12
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:03,188
spend their time in a fun,
lively and enjoyable way and relax.

13
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,363
Being an educator means
discovering new things every day,

14
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,114
including about yourself.

15
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,868
I really enjoy playing
with the children.

16
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:21,748
And helping them too, if they need it.
Because some children do need help.

17
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,501
Sometimes they just want
someone to talk to.

18
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:28,713
Just let yourself go and
have fun with the children.

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,841
Use your imagination,
enter the children's world.

20
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,012
We join in too and
I think that is important

21
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:39,683
because the children prefer that
and think it's more fun.

22
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,685
Some children don't like joining in.

23
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,729
But when they see us join in
they do too.

24
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,026
What I love doing is when the children
arrive in the morning, tired...

25
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,986
You try to wake them up.

26
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,156
In the morning we open the day
and dance and sing with the kids.

27
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,952
Then you see that the kids
are suddenly active and happy.

28
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,247
And that makes your day,
right from the start of it.

29
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,748
That's brilliant.
