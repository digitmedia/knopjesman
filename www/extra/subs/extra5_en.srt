1
00:00:01,626 --> 00:00:06,209
Our out of school care team is
very mixed and that is very enriching,

2
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:08,584
both for the parents and the children.

3
00:00:08,751 --> 00:00:12,584
We've got men in our team, women in
our team. They are various ages,

4
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:15,250
have various nationalities
and qualifications.

5
00:00:15,584 --> 00:00:18,876
That way all children and
all parents can find someone

6
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:23,083
they feel comfortable with, someone who
the children can enjoy themselves with,

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,459
someone who the parents can talk to
or seek advice from.

8
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:34,042
It's also great that
educators in out of school care

9
00:00:34,209 --> 00:00:38,417
can grow both personally
and professionally.

10
00:00:38,584 --> 00:00:41,959
They can follow a course in addition to
working in out of school care,

11
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,999
so that they can gain
a certificate or diploma.

12
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:48,584
And because they can use their talents
in the out of school provision,

13
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:51,250
they feel good about their job
and I see

14
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:55,626
they are able to develop further within
out of school care and outside it.

15
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:02,334
We get plenty of opportunity to
take extra training courses.

16
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:04,501
I'd worked here for six months and knew

17
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:08,999
that this was the sector
I would like to go further in.

18
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:12,999
I looked for a training course to take
so I could go further in it.

19
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,667
They give us the chance
to do that here.

20
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:19,292
I studied Socio-Cultural Work.

21
00:01:19,876 --> 00:01:23,167
I completed my studies and
now work here again full-time

22
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:28,042
and have an extra diploma
so I can go further in the sector.

23
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,876
Our team is very open to
learning from each other.

24
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:39,918
There are always trainees or
people in our team who are on a course.

25
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:44,167
So we often talk to each other

26
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:49,083
about things from the training course,
about how to handle children,

27
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,959
about the sort of activities
we do with the children.

28
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,542
All that makes us a better team

29
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:57,417
and a better out of school care centre
for the children.
