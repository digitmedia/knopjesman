1
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:06,751
We really believe that
children can learn from each other.

2
00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:09,999
We also believe they can learn
from each other's talents.

3
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:14,334
They are appreciated here
for who they are,

4
00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:17,292
for what they can do
and what they like doing.

5
00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:20,959
All children are welcome at our centre.

6
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:24,250
We also consciously look for
children in the community

7
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:28,083
who maybe don't need childcare
for economic reasons

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,792
but who would like to come and
have a great time doing fun things

9
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:34,125
and meeting other children.

10
00:00:34,292 --> 00:00:37,709
Every day we see that children,
regardless of where they come from,

11
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:41,209
regardless of their background,
of the school they go to,

12
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:46,125
just like to be children and, above all,
really like playing together.
