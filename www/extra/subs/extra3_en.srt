1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:13,221
Homework time consists of
us creating a basic, silent area

2
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:17,100
where the children are able
to do their homework.

3
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,777
From half past 4 to half past 5.
If they finish at a quarter to 5,

4
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:31,740
the children can go outside.
Nothing is compulsory.

5
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:37,912
The educators don't help the children
with their homework.

6
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,415
We just provide a quiet area

7
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,251
without really giving
any further explanation

8
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,712
and without helping with the homework.

9
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,548
But the children do
look after each other

10
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,844
and they more or less help each other.
